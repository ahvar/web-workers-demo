1.) JavaScript does not natively support threading. So how can we simulate threading? A web worker is a process through which you can tell a browser you have script that's likely to take some time and you'd like to run it asynchronously. Limited access to resources on the computer or browser (no access to DOM or window object), cannot modify UI.

2.)  What is the web worker structure? create new worker object in calling script and worker script to send message back to calling script.
